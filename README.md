## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There was no problem in writing code I perpared that in almost 1 and an half hour but the challange in this project for me was learning github
Because I didn't knew a single line of github

This project forced me to dive in to github and learn a lot about it
At least
[1]-making repositories (from github desktop and online github.com)
[2]-making different branches and working on them separately
[3]-hosting my projects and repositeries directly on github-pages

### Useful resources
